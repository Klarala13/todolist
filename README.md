# todolist

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
Small project built with Vue.js with same features as React's ToDo List that I had already made. No local storage. Reload will show API's default data. 
If you want to use it, add a local storage and erase fetch and post requests from axios to API.
